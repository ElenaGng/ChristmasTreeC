# ChristmasTreeC

My very first projet in Epitech
Pool projet made in 2 days
C programming

Instructions :
Write a function that displays a fir tree on the screen depending on a given size. A fir tree of size 0 will display nothing.
We will comple your file with the command cc, adding our ’main.c’.

Example :
~/pool_c_sapin> cc *.c –o sapin
~/pool_c_sapin> ./sapin

Example - This is a fir tree of size 1:
~/pool_c_sapin> ./sapin 1
